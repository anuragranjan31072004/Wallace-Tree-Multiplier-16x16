# Wallace-Tree-Multiplier-16x16
Designed and implemented a high-speed 16×16 Wallace Tree Multiplier in Verilog HDL using carry-save adders for parallel partial-product reduction. Compared performance with a conventional Array Multiplier and verified functionality using corner cases and 1000+ random test vectors in ModelSim.
