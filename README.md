# Wallace Tree Multiplier (16×16)

## Overview
This project implements a high-speed 16×16 Wallace Tree Multiplier in Verilog HDL. The design uses carry-save adders for parallel partial-product reduction, significantly reducing propagation delay compared to a conventional Array Multiplier.

## Features
- Structural Wallace Tree architecture
- Parallel carry-save reduction
- Behavioral Array Multiplier for comparison
- Verified using corner cases and 1000+ random test vectors
- Simulated in ModelSim (Intel FPGA)

## Tools & Technologies
- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim (Intel FPGA Starter Edition)

## Applications
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- VLSI arithmetic units
- High-speed computing systems
